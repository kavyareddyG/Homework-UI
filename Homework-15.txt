1)About Event Delegation?
     The delegate () method is used to attach one or more event handlers for specified elements which are the children of selected elements. This method executes
 a function to run when the event occurs.
The attached event handlers with the delegate () method works for both current and future elements.    

Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html lang="en">  
<head>   
  <title>delegate demo</title>  
  <style>  
  p {  
    background: yellow;  
    font-weight: bold;  
    cursor: pointer;  
    padding: 5px;  
  }  
  p.over {  
    background: #ccc;  
  }  
  span {  
    color: red;  
  }  
  </style>  
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.js"></script>  
</head>  
<body>  
<p>This is a single paragraph. Click me for next.</p>  
<script>  
$( "body" ).delegate( "p", "click", function() {  
  $(this ).after( "<p>Click me for another paragraph.</p>" );  
});  
</script>  
</body>  
</html>

4) $(document).ready vs window.onload?
   The ready event occurs after the HTML document has been loaded, while the onload event occurs later, when all content (e.g. images) also has been loaded. 
The onload event is a standard event in the DOM, while the ready event is specific to jQuery.
