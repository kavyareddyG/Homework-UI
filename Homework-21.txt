1) what is factory write and example.
   -- we use a return keyword
  -- we can return any javascrit data type
  -- return any java script data type (object, number, undefined, boolean, ..., function).
  -- we can inject factories into controller.
module.factory('MyService', function() {
var factory = {}; 
factory.method1 = function() {
//..
}
factory.method2 = function() {
//..
}
return factory;
});


2) what is service write and example?
singleton 
only one object through out the entire application.
we dont have to use a return keyword.
Service can only provide a Object.
its is instatiated once. its uses new keyword internally for the first time.
suppose if you want to define any helper methods.
if same piece of functionality is needed in multiple controller. Better put it in a service and make it available in the needed controllers.
 
module.service('MyService', function() {
	this.method1 = function() {
			//..
		}

	this.method2 = function() {
			//..
		}
}); 
3) what are diff between factory and service? are both of them singleton? what is singleton?
  module.service( 'serviceName', function );

module.factory( 'factoryName', function );

When declaring serviceName as an injectable argument you will be provided with an instance of the function. In other words 
new FunctionYouPassedToService(). This object instance becomes the service object that AngularJS registers and injects later 
to other services / controllers if required.

When declaring factoryName as an injectable argument you will be provided with the value that is returned by invoking the 
function reference passed to module.factory.

 In factory we created a factory object and assigned the methods to it.

4) how to make ajax calls using $http  and all methods of http like(get, post, put and delete).
$http is an AngularJS service for reading data from remote servers.

The AngularJS $http service makes a request to the server, and returns a response.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.4.8/angular.min.js"></script>
<body>

<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl"> 

<p>Today's welcome message is:</p>

<h1>{{myWelcome}}</h1>

</div>

<p>The $http service requests a page on the server, and the response is set as the value of the "myWelcome" variable.</p>

<script>
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope, $http) {
  $http({
    method : "GET",
    url : "welcome.htm"
  }).then(function mySucces(response) {
      $scope.myWelcome = response.data;
    }, function myError(response) {
      $scope.myWelcome = response.statusText;
  });
});
</script>

</body>
</html>

5) What is $q?
  A service that helps you run functions asynchronously, and use their return values (or exceptions) when they are done 
processing.
