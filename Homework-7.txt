 1)try to understand sass pre processor
      In SASS we are having some features like nestins,mixins,variables,inheritance etc.,that doesn't exist in CSS. with these features we can design and maintain
 style sheets very easily.

We are having two files when working with SASS
1).scss ->input file
2).css ->output file


2) advantages of using sass?
   1)It uses the standard CSS syntax.
   2)maintaing the code is very much easier.
   3)code reusability-In the future if we want to reuse the code or if we want to modify the code then the task becomes very much easier with SASS.

3) differences between sass,less and stylus?
  SASS preprocessor:
     1)SASS used the .scss file extension.
     2)It uses the semi-columns and curly brackets but previously it didn't used them.

    Without using semi-columns in sass
     /* style.sass */
    h1
  color: #0982c1

with semi-columns
h1 {
  color: #0982C1;
}

LESS preprocessor:
1) It also uses the standard CSS syntax.
2)LESS uses the .less file extension.
3)It uses the semi-columns and curly brackets.
 
Example:
h1 {
  color: #0982C1;
}

STYLUS preprocessor:
1) It also uses the standard CSS syntax.
2)STYLUS uses the .styl file extension.
3)brackets, colons, and semi-colons are all optional. 

Example: with brackets,colons and semi-colons
/* style.styl */
h1 {
  color: #0982C1;
}
 
/* omit brackets */
h1
  color: #0982C1;
 
/* omit colons and semi-colons */
h1
  color #0982C1;

Example: with no colons and brackets,compile without any error.

h1 {
  color #0982c1
}
h2
  font-size: 1.2em
