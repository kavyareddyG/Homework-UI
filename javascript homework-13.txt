1) java script call apply bind methods? how to use them? what are the use cases when we have to use them?
                we have objects and for each object they have their own properties and methods.By using cal,apply and bind methods we can write common methods to 
different objects.

Call method:
        

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title></title>
</head>
<body>
var obj={num:2};
var addToThis = function(a);
{
return this.num+a;
};
Console.log(addToThis.call(obj,3));//functinname.call(obj,fuctionarguments);
</body>
</html>
 
addToThis function was called for the object. The property of the object was accessed by this.num and this.num is 2 and it added to a which is 3.so the o/p is 5.

apply method: Instead of passing the argument we can pass array as function arguments and bind the data.
 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title></title>
</head>
<body>
var obj={num:2};
var addToThis = function(a);
{
return this.num+a;
};
var arr = [1,2,3];
Console.log(addToThis.apply(obj,arr));
</body>
</html>

0/p:8

Bind method: we can bind the array with different objects.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title></title>
</head>
<body>
var obj1={num:2};
var obj2={num:2};
var addToThis = function(a);
{
return this.num+a;
};
var arr = [1,2,3];
Console.log(addToThis.bind(obj1,arr));
Console.log(addToThis.bind(obj2,arr));
</body>
</html>
